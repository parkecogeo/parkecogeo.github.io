## Bio

I'm a research scientist at the [NASA Ames Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/) and [Bay Area Environmental Research Institute](https://baeri.org/) within the [NASA Earth Exchange (NEX)](https://www.nasa.gov/nex) in Mountain View, CA. I completed my BS and MS education at the [Korea University](https://eco.korea.ac.kr/) and my major of both BS/MS is in Environmental Science & Ecological Engineering. During the master’s program, I joined the [Environmental Geopgraphic Information System and Remote Sensing Lab](https://www.egisrs.org/) lead by [Woo-Kyun Lee](https://eco.korea.ac.kr/professor-main-menu/professor-detail?id=28). I earned a Ph.D. in Earth and Environment (Geography) from Boston University in 2019 while working in the [Remote Sensing of Vegetation and Climate Research Group](https://sites.bu.edu/cliveg/) advised by [Ranga B. Myneni](https://www.bu.edu/earth/profiles/ranga-myneni/).


## Research Focus

My research vision is ‘Creating actionable environmental and ecological information to make our society and ecosystem more just and sustainable’. To achieve this goal, my research uses multi-platform remote-sensing, in situ measurements, and process-based models to understand processes impacting ecosystems and works closely with end-users to make effective and impactful plans and actions. I've been working on two NASA funded projects: [Carbon Monitoring System (CMS)](https://carbon.nasa.gov/) and [Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI)](https://gedi.umd.edu/). Additionally, I've been actively interacting with researchers in the NEX team to build a global-scale geostationary satellite product suite ([GeoNEX](https://www.nasa.gov/geonex)).
