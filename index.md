# Bio

Thomas is a research scientist at the [NASA Ames Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/) and [Bay Area Environmental Research Institute](https://baeri.org/) within the [NASA Earth Exchange (NEX)](https://www.nasa.gov/nex) in Mountain View, CA. He is the Principle Investigator (PI) of a NASA ROSES grant studying optical flow methodologies for tracking atmospheric motion in satellite imagery. Thomas earned a Ph.D. in Interdisciplinary Engineering from Northeastern University in 2018 while working in the [Sustainability and Data Sciences Lab](https://web.northeastern.edu/sds/) advised by [Auroop R. Ganguly](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/ganguly-auroop/). During graduate school his research won [runner-up best paper award at SIGKDD 2017](https://www.kdd.org/awards/view/2017-sigkdd-best-paper-award-winners), outstanding graduate researcher at Northeastern University in 2018, and served as an elected student member of the committee on [Artificial Intelligence Applications to Environmental Science for the American Meterological Society (AMS)](https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/stac/committees/committee-on-artificial-intelligence-applications-to-environmental-science/membership/). Prior to graduate school he worked at startups in the Boston area, including the MIT Media Lab spin-out Affectiva.  He completed his bachelors in mathematics at the University of Maryland College Park in 2012.
