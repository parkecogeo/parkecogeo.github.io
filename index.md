Taejin’s research focuses on the application of satellite- and airborne remote-sensing, in situ measurements, and process-based models to understand processes impacting terrestrial ecosystems and carbon cycle. He is currently working on two NASA funded projects: Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI). Additionally, he has been actively interacting with researchers in the NEX team to build a global-scale geostationary satellite product suite (GeoNEX).


# Bio

Taejin is a research scientist at the [NASA Ames Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/) and [Bay Area Environmental Research Institute](https://baeri.org/) within the [NASA Earth Exchange (NEX)](https://www.nasa.gov/nex) in Mountain View, CA. He completed his BS and MS education at the [Korea University](https://eco.korea.ac.kr/) and his major of both BS/MS is in Environmental Science & Ecological Engineering. During the master’s program, Taejin joined the [Environmental Geopgraphic Information System and Remote Sensing Lab](https://www.egisrs.org/) lead by [Woo-Kyun Lee](https://eco.korea.ac.kr/professor-main-menu/professor-detail?id=28). Taejin earned a Ph.D. in Environmental and Earth Science from Boston University in 2019 while working in the [Remote Sensing of Vegetation and Climate Research Group](https://sites.bu.edu/cliveg/) advised by [Ranga B. Myneni](https://www.bu.edu/earth/profiles/ranga-myneni/).
